## Notes

This is an experimental project that utilizes chakra ui and next js to fetch posts, subreddits and also comments through Reddit's API

## More Notes

Things that can be improved on: GIFs sadly doesn't work for now.
I plan to add search functionality maybe in the future, who knows
View More comments is a pain to work on, so I've ommitted these for now.
